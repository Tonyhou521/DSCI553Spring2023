This is Shengtao Tony Hou's Submission for DSCI553 Assignment 1.

This class was taken in the Spring of 2023.

This Assignment focuses on the idea of MapReduce and we are asked to implement various ideas in MapReduce using Spark RDD, we also learnt the differences between the idea of Transformations and Actions, which are two operation types of Spark RDD. This single feature helps Spark to be more efficient and minimize the time and resource for data mining.
